#### How hard was this exercise?
Not that hard, it was fun... a neat challenge.  I think if I had just gone after the easy stuff first it would have been simple.  Instead I spent a couple of hours having fun going through the Flickr API as well as the Reddit API and experimenting.  In the end I figured out how to pull images out of a subreddit and then diplay them on a page.  My thought was to do this and add images to an array and select from that array a random cat picture and have a click on that random picture.  I would store the number of clicks per image and display them on the image in meme lettering format stolen from the project three work I did.  

#### How do you feel about your code?
Meh.  I didn't put a lot of time into it.  I pulled and modified the javascrip from a jsFiddle I found: http://jsfiddle.net/ots6jdyL/

I used a bootsrap template / example from the bootstrap getting started site.  I didn't do any optimizations and didn't spend any time trying to make it pretty. 

There are lots of things that i would like to do per the above note but didn't spend the time on it. 

#### How many times did you click on you picture?
 - 18, yes... eighteen amazing times! :)
